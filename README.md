## Algorithm for optimizing masonry cuts for a robotic saw

To optimize the cuts of masonry elements for a robotic saw, a new packaging algorithm for the optimal design of a digital cutting plan was created. The algorithm is based on the principle of random search of all combinations of cutting execution with respect to the maximum number of objects (cuts) in one container (masonry element). The new packag-ing algorithm minimizes the number of entire masonry elements (containers) and the number of cuts of the robotic saw for less wear on the cutting cloth. The algorithm con-verges very quickly and reliably finds optimal variants of the digital plan of the robotic saw for various object assemblies. The article describes the algorithm, including step-by-step calculations, a practical example, and a comparison of results with existing algorithms. The concept of the robotic saw is also described in detail, including a descrip-tion of the prototype. Applying this methodology to robotic bricklaying process will re-duce the generation of construction waste and increase the speed of construction of buildings.
